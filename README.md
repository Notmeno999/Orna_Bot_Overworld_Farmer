You can download the game from the official website or a trusted source. Make sure to download the correct version (Android or iOS) that corresponds to your emulator.

5. Modify the filter options:
Uncheck everything except "Show monsters" to make the bot easier to use.

6. Modify the script for your own values:

Replace "Bolt" with the word for your own attack. You can also modify the confidence and threshold values if you encounter any problems with finding images or strings.

7. Take new screenshots for the image files if necessary:

If the program cannot find the images, take new screenshots for the image files (cancel.png, filter.png, items.png, lucky_coin.png). Make sure the images are in the same location as the script.

8. Run the script:
Open the script in Python IDLE or any other Python editor. Set buffer to true if you want the bot to buff your character before running the script. By default, the buffer will run every 60 minutes.

9. Start the bot:

Click on the "Start" button to start the bot. The bot will automatically buff your character, heal your character after each battle, find enemies, and battle enemies.

Note:

Make sure to read the script carefully and understand how it works before running it.
The bot may not work perfectly, and you may encounter some issues.
The bot may not prevent you from getting banned, so use it at your own risk.
